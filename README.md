## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a global dataset containing **194 countries** and **64 unique socio-economic variables**. The analysis focuses on demographic distribution, political leadership, and the ranking of nations based on democratic performance and geographic regions.

> **Objective:** To leverage Python for extracting key geopolitical insights, such as identifying the most populous nations, mapping regional demographics, and analyzing the "Republic" naming convention across global territories.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Dataset:** `Countries.csv` (covering 64 columns including GDP, Population, Democracy Scores, and Land Area)

---

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Demographic Profiling:** Automated identification of population extremes (e.g., India as the most populous, Tuvalu as the least).
* **Political Leadership Mapping:** Linked leadership data with demographic metrics to identify key figures in major nations (e.g., Xi Jinping for the 2nd most populous country).
* **Democratic Performance Ranking:** Multi-column sorting to isolate top-tier democratic nations like Norway, Iceland, and Sweden.
* **Custom Text Processing:** Built specialized functions to count and categorize countries based on specific naming conventions within their official long-form titles.
* **Regional Sub-setting:** Created isolated data structures for deep-dives into specific continents, such as identifying Nigeria as the population leader in the Africa region.
